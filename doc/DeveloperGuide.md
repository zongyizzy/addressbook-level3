## Appendix A : User Stories

Priorities: High (must have) - `* * *`, Medium (nice to have)  - `* *`,  Low (unlikely to have) - `*`


Priority | As a ... | I want to ... | So that I can...

`* * *` | new user | see usage instructions | refer to instructions when I forget how to use the App
`* * *` | user | add a new person |
`* * *` | user | delete a person | remove entries that I no longer need
`* * *` | user | find a person by name | locate details of persons without having to go through the entire list
`* *` | user | set a passcode for my addressbook | I can keep my addressbook private
`* *` | user | hide [private contact details](#private-contact-detail) by default | to minimize chance of someone else seeing them by accident
`*` | user with many persons in the address book | sort persons by name | locate a person easily
`*` | user | mark a contac as favorite | quickly access to favorite's contact
